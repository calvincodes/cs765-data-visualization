# CS 765 Data Visualization (Fall 2019)
Collection of my repositories for CS 765 Data Visualization (Fall 2019)

## My grades for these solutions

| Assignment    | Score         | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| DC2 (Final)             | 88/100         | Sequence of interactive visualizations. They seem independent.<br>Bonus for the effort to get things on Heroku. Effort to evaluate Python libraries and choose and appropriate one, as well as to learn it.<br>Tasks are ill-specified, and its not clear how the designs support them. The use cases show specific details (you can see X - usually a specific number, could have been easily found in a state table)<br>Timeline views (since they are sparse) are odd to read. Also, they get quite congested. Made better with the pan tool (not integrated, but clearly would have been with more time)<br>Nicely implemented simple views, with some thought as to how to address their scalability issues.<br>Lack of design rationale / connection to task makes this hard to give an A to. A lot of views that show details given a query.     |
| DC3 (Final)             | 82/100         | Type 3. Multiple Designs, Not-Integrated<br>
+/- web deployed app, but only seems for part of assignment<br>+/- treemaps used for 1 level only<br>+ compares suburst and treemap in terms of what they show, but not task<br>- missing specific tasks<br>- missing use case<br>- missing data findings<br>+ many options to tree viewer<br>- little discussion of rationale for tree display choices<br>- simplistic implementation of tree layouts<br>+/- some scalability discussion    |
